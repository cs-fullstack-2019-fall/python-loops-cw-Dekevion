# Python: Loops Classwork

Create a new project for this work. Each exercise should be in it's own file.

### Exercise 1:
Print -20 to and including 50. Use any loop you want.

### Exercise 2:
Create a loop that prints even numbers from 0 to and including 20.

### Exercise 3:
Prompt the user for 3 numbers. Then print the sum of the numbers after the 3rd number is entered.

### Exercise 4:
Password Checker - Ask the user to enter a password. Ask them to confirm the password. If it's not equal, keep asking until it's correct or they enter 'Q' to quit.

## BONUS:
FIZZBUZZ is the classic Programmer's challenge often used as part of job interviews:

* Prompt the User for the ending value (e.g. 100)

* Your code should start at 1 and then iterate each number up to the ending value entered by the user

* If the current number is evenly divisible by 3 you should print "FIZZ" and the number

* If the current number is evenly divisible by 5 you should print "BUZZ" and the number

* If the current number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 you should print "FIZZBUZZ" and the number to the screen

* Otherwise, just print the original number
